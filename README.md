# Human-Following-Robot-Using-Arduino-and-Ultrasonic-Sensor

In recent years, robotics has witnessed significant advancements, enabling the creation of intelligent machines that can interact with the environment. One exciting application of robotics is the development of human-following robots. These robots can track and follow a person autonomously, making them useful in various scenarios like assistance in crowded areas, navigation support, or even as companions. In this article, we will explore in detail how to build a human-following robot using Arduino and three ultrasonic sensors. Also check all the Arduino based Robotics projects by following the link.

Building a human-following robot using Arduino and three ultrasonic sensors is an interesting project. What makes this project particularly interesting is the use of not just one, but three ultrasonic sensors. This adds a new dimension to the experience, as we typically see human following robot build with one ultrasonic, two IR and one servo motor.  This servo motor has no role in operation and also added unnecessary complications. So I removed this servo and IR sensors and use 3 ultrasonic sensors. With ultrasonic sensors, you can measure distance and use that information to navigate and follow a human target. Here’s a general outline of the steps involved in creating such a robot.

Necessary Components Needed for Human Following Robot:

Arduino UNO board ×1

Ultrasonic sensor ×3

L298N motor driver ×1

Robot chassis

BO motors ×2

Wheels ×2

Li-ion battery 3.7V ×2

Battery holder ×1

Breadboard

Ultrasonic sensor holder ×3

Switch and jumper wires

Conclusion:

Building a human-following robot using Arduino and three ultrasonic sensors is an exciting and rewarding project that combines programming, electronics, and mechanics. With Arduino’s versatility and the availability of affordable components, creating your own human-following robot is within reach.

Human-following robots have a wide range of applications in various filed like they can be used in retail stores, malls, and hotels to provide personalized assistance to customers. Human-following robots can be employed in security and surveillance system to track and monitor individuals in public spaces. They can be used in Entertainment and events, elderly care, guided tours, research and development, education and research, and personal robotics.

They are just a few examples of the applications of human-following robots. As technology advances and robotics continues to evolve, we can expect even more diverse and innovative applications in the future.
